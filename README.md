# Protein-Music-Generation
This Python script bridges bioinformatics and music by converting protein sequences into melodies. By analyzing protein structures and mapping amino acids to musical notes based on their secondary structures, the script generates unique MIDI files that audibly represent the proteinâ€™s characteristics.
# Features
- Protein Data Retrieval: Downloads protein structures directly from the RCSB PDB database.
- Sequence Analysis: Extracts amino acid sequences from PDB files using Biopython.
- Musical Mapping: Maps amino acids to notes based on their properties and secondary structure elements (e.g., helix, sheet, or coil).
- MIDI File Export: Creates a playable MIDI file to experience proteins as music.
